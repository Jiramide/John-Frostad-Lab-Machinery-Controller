# John-Frostad-Lab-Machinery-Controller

### What will you be building, and how will it be used?

Deep dive into the fascinating world of food science and chemical engineering research machinery control at the John Forstad Lab at UBC! You will be developing an all-encompassing Python controller for existing hardware, adding a programmable touch to what was previously manually operated. Imagine functions that can seamlessly control LED lights, coordinate hardware like the pump and valve, and trigger the camera to capture images upon illumination. The project involves working on the ParCS (Particle Cohort Study) machinery, where the coordination of these actions is critical. We are looking to create not just functions but also a master Python script that calls all these functions with input, orchestrating the dance of the machinery in the lab.

### Why is it important?
This project holds the potential to enhance the research capabilities of the John Forstad Lab significantly. By offering programmable control over previously manual tasks, we aim to introduce efficiency, precision, and repeatability to the lab's operations. This Python controller will be the conductor, guiding the symphony of research machinery, ultimately contributing to the vital work carried out at the lab.

### Key Technologies/Skills:

#### For Developers:

This is certainly one of the more complex project, so this is your chance to learn and grow:

- **Python:** Basic understanding of Python is needed.
- **Hardware Control:** Any experience with programming hardware control, including LEDs, cameras, and pumps, would be helpful.
- **SDKs:** Familiarity with working with SDKs would be an advantage.

#### For Tech Leads:

As a Tech Lead, we need you to have a strong foundation and (preferrably) demonstratable experience in the above skills, as well as:

- **Team Leadership:** The ability to guide and coordinate a team of developers is a must.
- **Systems Design:** You will need to have an understanding of how to design a Python script that coordinates several pieces of hardware.
- **User Experience Design:** The ability to guide the team in creating a user-friendly system, possibly with a GUI.
- **Hardware/Software Integration:** Familiarity with integrating software and hardware operations would be ideal.
- **Interest in Research:** Though being interested in research is not required, it would be a plus.
